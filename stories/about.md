My name is Joshua Barratt. [serialized.net](http://serialized.net) is my personal blog. It's been slapped around and become many things many different times -- from Movable Type to Textpattern to a SweetCron lifestream to Habari to Chyrp to Wordpress and [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), then Jekyll/[Octopress framework](http://octopress.org), and currently [Nikola](http://getnikola.com/). I might have a problem.

The name serialized has a double meaning. For programmers, to 'serialize' something is to take something from a live, running program and store it on disk in a way that can be brought back to life later, possibly by a different program. I liked that aspect -- I'm dumping life thoughts and threads from my life onto disk, where some other reader will pick them up and bring them to life in their head. I also like the way the name (albeit with slightly different spelling) is a callback to [serial novels][1] like Sherlock Holmes.

I tend to write about my passions and obsessions -- the phrase "Fascination Burnout" comes from Neal Stephenson via [Binary Bonsai](http://binarybonsai.com/2009/01/03/fascination-burnout/)

 > “I am fascinated,” I insisted, “That’s the problem. I am suffering from fascination burnout. Of all the things that are fascinating, I have to choose just one or two.”

I'm still learning to choose the one or two and the things that I'm currently playing with will probably show up here in one way or another.
