My name is Joshua Barratt. serialized.net is my personal blog. It's been slapped around and become many things many different times -- from Movable Type to Textpattern to a SweetCron lifestream to Habari to Chyrp to Wordpress and [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), then Jekyll/[Octopress framework](http://octopress.org), and currently [Nikola](http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar/) -- it's been quite a road.

The name serialized has a double meaning. For programmers, to 'serialize' something is to take something from a live, running program and store it on disk in a way that can be brought back to life later, possibly by a different program. I liked that aspect -- I'm dumping life thoughts and threads from my life onto disk, where some other reader will pick them up and bring them to life in their head. I also like the way the name (albeit with slightly different spelling) is a callback to [serial novels][1] like Sherlock Holmes.

I tend to write about my passions and obsessions -- the phrase "Fascination Burnout" comes from Neal Stephenson via [Binary Bonsai](http://binarybonsai.com/2009/01/03/fascination-burnout/)

{% blockquote %}
 “I am fascinated,” I insisted, “That’s the problem. I am suffering from fascination burnout. Of all the things that are fascinating, I have to choose just one or two.”
{% endblockquote %}

I'm still learning to choose the one or two and the things that I'm currently playing with will probably show up here in one way or another.

Current probabilities:

* Family: Level up Husband and Dad Skills
* Electronics/Arduino
* Crossfit/Kettlebells/Fitness
* Photography/Lighting
* Music (Bass and Rhythm Guitar)
* Perl, Javascript, Python, C/C++, Processing/Wiring, Ruby
* Data -- Small to Big
* Development, Operations, Devops
* Kanban, Lean, Agile
* Linux, OpenSolaris (RIP), Mac, iPhone
* Almost all reading -- technical, fictional, business, philosophical
* Cooking
* Travel

I'm exhausted just writing it all down. I'm sure that's a partial list.
