We just got back from a great weekend in Mammoth. I'd never been there before, but it was well worth the trip. My only beef from the whole weekend was that on Sunday, even with bad weather and over 60% closed lifts, they didn't offer vouchers or partial refunds or anything other than a "tough rocks."

The one thing I am considering for our next multi-day snowboard trip, however, is some form of more robust sun protection. I'm thinking along the lines of a stylish full-face graphic rendered in non-toxic latex paint... even with sunscreen I got a brutal burn, and it was way too hot to wear full-face coverage.
