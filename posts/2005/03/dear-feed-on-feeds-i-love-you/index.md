If you
<ol>
<li>Have a web server with MySQL and PHP</li>
<li>Read sites that have RSS feeds on a semi-regular basis</li>
<li>Ever use different computers, or can't find a desktop aggregator you like...</li>
</ol>
do yourself a favor and install [Feed On Feeds.](http://feedonfeeds.com/)
<p>
The only notes I have:
Do use the auto-subscribe bookmarklet.
Don't forget to set up a cron job to update the feeds.
Don't forget to htpasswd protect the directory -- every link you click will have your FoF install as the Referrer URL.
</p>

I think the thing I like best about having an aggregator is that I can happily subscribe to infrequently updating sites _cough cough like this one_ and I just get to see all the updates when they hit my browser. Subscribing to a weblog no longer means having to troll it (in)frequently for updates that might not be coming.
