I broke out the mini-tripod to try and get a better photo of our new kittens, Gwen and Misha. Here they are in all their sleepy cuteness:

They are getting much better -- they certainly seem to be more comfortable around us and with our presence. They love to snuggle, purring for ever while you pet them -- but  all the while, if you give them the chance to leave, they'll jet away from you like you are on fire. Baby steps :)
