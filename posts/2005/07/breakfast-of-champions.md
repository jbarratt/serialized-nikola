<p>So I started off today with a delicious sandwich. (There's a big BBQ tonight, so I figured I'd go the brunch route.)
Improv'd recipe:
Slice a length of rustic baguette long enough to match your appetite, then slice it in 1/2 down the flatter axis. Spread on Wasabi Mayo (all that was in the fridge, any regular mayo would work as well, or butter) on both sides. Lay down 3 or 4 anchovy fillets on on side of the bread. Take 6 balls of fresh water-packed mozzerella and smash them flat, laying them on top of the bread. Place under broiler and broil until the cheese is bubbly and starting to brown. While browning, tear up a handful of fresh basil. Remove bread from the broiler, sprinkle on the basil generously, and reassemble as a sandwich.</p>

Very, very good. I didn't expect the wasabi to go quite so well as it did, but it's obvious companionship with fish (as witnessed in sushi) played out when it was paired with the anchovies. They, in turn, bridged to the flavors of italy in the basil/mozzarella/wonderful crusty bread. All in all a great way to start the morning! (Actually, almost entirely a Trader Joe's creation, as well -- the bread, mayo, cheese and basil all came from there.)
