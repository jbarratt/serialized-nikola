Amber and I adopted 2 kittens this weekend. They've both had a rough start in life so are a little (ok, a lot) slow to warm up to humans. We're sure that with enough TLC they'll be great cats -- they both show signs of being very smart and curious. As soon as they get a little more sociable I can probably have them pose for more flattering photos -- (sorry about the orange-eye) -- but for now this will do to introduce them.

### Gwen

She's a [Tonkinese](http://animal.discovery.com/guides/cats/selector/profile.jsp?id=4080) mix, as best they can tell. She's the fiesty one -- she likes to unleash a cute rumbly little growl when you are intruding on her space. We also found that she crawls into our bed, waaay under the covers, for snuggly little naps -- so if you come and visit, do the 'pat test' before you sit on the bed.

### Misha

Misha's a [Korat](http://animal.discovery.com/guides/cats/selector/profile.jsp?id=3020) mix (again, as far as we can tell.) She's the braver one, happy to sit out in the middle of the floor and actually look at us, instead of always sneaking around the baseboards.
