There are lots of people having fun out there with the [Comic Life](http://plasq.com/downloads/) software, which is unavailable to me due to the macness of it all. However, some of the examples out there of people using it are really cool! Observe the [Amateur Gourmet](http://www.amateurgourmet.com/)'s tale of [Lolita and the Pine-Nut cookies.](http://www.amateurgourmet.com/the_amateur_gourmet/2005/04/lolita_and_the_.html) It leads to a very fun to read style while still presenting the information you need. I much prefer it to the 'traditional' food blog photos-with-captions.
