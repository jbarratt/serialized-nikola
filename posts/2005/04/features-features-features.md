Hehe, I love marketing garbage. I'm looking for a new laptop for work with some specific features we need.
These really help me narrow it down:

> Features:
>
> * Sparkle with impeccable style
> * Lighten up and relax
> * Shine with brilliant performance
> * Blaze ahead with the hottest

Well. As long as I can blaze ahead with the hottest, that laptop will do me just fine. Only sissies care about, oh, graphics chipsets and screen resolution.
