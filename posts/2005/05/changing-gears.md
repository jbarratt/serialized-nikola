So I've been pretty busy recently, mostly because I [switched](http://conceptoverdrive.com) [jobs](http://mediatemple.net). Media Temple had a need that I was able to fill, so I've returned there and it looks like it should be fun.

<p>Part of the fun is the new building (mt)'s moving to soon, "the box."
[Exterior](http://www.ericowenmoss.com/box.html)
[Interior](http://www.davidbartle.com/new_office_panoramic1.jpg) (warning, large panorama!)</p>

Anyway, lots of fun. As soon as I get back into a schedule of sorts with the new job, I'm sure I'll have new and fascinating things to be posting again :)
