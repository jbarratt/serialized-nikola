I've just had doctor's orders to make some changes to make my cholesterol picture a bit prettier. Apparently my total levels aren't bad, but my LDL/HDL ratio leaves something to be desired. To that end, I was wondering how I may look at altering my cooking to help with the other things I'll be doing. (Primarily exercise and portion control.)

I know the information out there is very volatile -- some of it is biased, some of it is based on flawed studies or has been disproven -- but I thought I'd do an aggregate of what I found and just try and come up with some broad guidelines.

### Things to avoid
Fats solid at room temperature. (Butter, margarine, any animal renderings, cream)
Spiking carbohydrates. (Blood sugar spikes can possibly lower HDL levels.)

### Things to include
Red wine, within reason.
Orange Juice (Careful of the sugar spike.)
Beans, esp. Kidney and Red.
Omega 3: Fish, (Best: salmon, anchovy, sardine, mackerel.) (flaxseed, safflower, sunflower, canola) oil, dark green vegetables.
Use Olive/Canola oil for cooking and dressings.
Oat Bran. (2oz/day Improved LDL/HDL ratios dramatically in one study.)
Onion! (1/2 a raw onion a day, not sure if it's worth the tax on my marriage.)
Soy Products. (Lowered total, raised HDL.)
Soluble fiber. (Apples, grapes, citrus, whole grains: oats, oat bran, brown rice, and legumes and lentils)
Avacado. (You don't know how happy I was to see _this._)
Garlic
Spinach
Nuts (Walnuts, cashews, almonds)
Tea
Dark Chocolate
Non-food: "Being slim." Ok, I have a ways to go on _that_ one.

<p>I like that list because it implies certain sets of dishes which I like, and which can be made in a healthy way.
Tofu Curry over Brown Rice.
Spinach lightly sauteed in garlic-infused olive oil.
Nutty whole-grain muffins.
SUSHI!!! (Salmon/Mackerel are already on my 'favorites' list, nice.)
Homemade brown rice salmon handrolls anybody?
And so forth. There's a whole lot of 'yum' in that list, and an awful lot of extra-affordable foods as well.</p>

I'm going to have to work on cooking with legumes and lentils, I've never really gotten up to speed there. Anyway, I'll add to this list as I find things, and maybe start gathering some recipes. It's nice that I have to go get tested again in 6 weeks, it gives me a nice window to be jumping in with both feet.

**Update**: I just looked down and saw my last entry. SIGH. No wonder I'm having problems, look at all those no-no's. Processed wheat in the pasta, cream, parmesan, animal fats galore... tsk tsk. It's a good thing I'm on the straight and narrow now :)
