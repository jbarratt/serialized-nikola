.. title: An Argument for Containers, featuring Docker
.. slug: an-argument-for-containers-featuring-docker

I was invited to speak at the `All Things Open 2013
<http://www.allthingsopen.org/>`_ conference in Raleigh, NC, and took the
opportunity to talk about a project I've been researching and experimenting with a lot recently: `Docker <http://docker.io>`_. For a first year conference, it was fantastic. My hearty thanks to the organizers for taking such great care of us and curating a solid, interesting lineup.

I got a `lot <https://twitter.com/jpetazzo/status/393523628836278272>`_ `of <https://twitter.com/solomonstre/status/393567768156467201>`_ `nice <https://twitter.com/BMorearty/status/393564501041115136>`_ `feedback <https://twitter.com/golubbe/status/393531106584047616>`_ about the presentation (in person as well) which was heartening, so I thought it would be worth sharing here. It's a `reveal.js <http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/>`_ presentation, so click inside the box and use the arrow keys to nagivate.
