The [Personal Kanban blog](http://personalkanban.com/pk/blog) ran a
great pair of articles on "Lean Meetings" ([part 1](http://www.personalkanban.com/pk/designpatterns/democratize-meetings-with-personal-kanban/),
[part 2](http://www.personalkanban.com/pk/expert/lean-meetings-2-semper-gumby/).)

I recommend reading through them to get more context for what follows,
but I'll re-share one of the biggest insights: the point of a meeting is
to _have a conversation._ Pre-set agendas feel like best practice, but
they can get in the way of that 'true goal' more often than not.

> Control, agendas, and procedures impeded conversation, focusing on the
> structure of the meeting rather than the topics at hand. If you want
> people to engage in and feel theyâ€™ve derived value from your meeting,
> make them feel respected, not restricted.

After having orchestrated a few meetings using this idea, some helpful
practices have emerged, which seemed worth sharing.

The basic framework still holds:

1. _Framework_: Draw a Personal Kanban
2. _Personal Agendas_: Invite all attendees to write their topics on sticky
notes
3. _Democratization_: Invite all attendees to vote on the topics on the table (each person gets two votes)
4. _Group Agenda:_ Prioritize the sticky notes
5. _Discuss_

The riffs on that list are:

## Framework

We found that converting (To Do, Doing, Done) to (To Do, _Goals_, Doing,
_Takeaways_, Done) has been helpful.

Here is what those new substeps entail: 

### Goals

Before we actually start discussing a topic, create a shared
understanding of what we hope to get out of it.
Paraphrasing David Allen, "what does 'wild success' look like at the end of
this?" What is the value we need to deliver to our customers
or organization by the time we're done?

Concretely, this can come down to basic things. Plan fall employee
event? The goals might be "Define vision, date, coordinator, and
budget."

It can also be fuzzier: "Understand each other's feelings about this
topic."

In practice, it's been interesting how hard it can be for a team to get this
articulated -- and there's a high correlation between "hard to find
goals" and "conversations that would wander and go nowhere."

Mechanically, as is hinted at in the diagram above, we found it natural
to add a new sticky with the goals on it as a "rider" to the original
topic note. That kept the goals clear and visible to everyone, and they
were referred to frequently.

### Takeaways

This is probably implicit in what it means to move a topic from "Doing"
into "Done", but it's helpful as a reminder. "Who is responsible for
taking things away from this item?" It's a good hook for recording
things, especially if there's no formal note-taker.

We also use this as a hook to make sure to consider how any conclusions
(or lack thereof) need to be communicated to the wider group that was
not in attendance at the meeting.

## Personal Agendas

At this point we've only really used this idea as-written, but I'm
curious to play with various
brainstorming/[gamestorming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamestorming) or focusing techniques to
help generate higher-value items for the team to choose from, rather
than those that happen to be top-of-mind for the participants (or have
been recorded in their own trusted systems.)

We did bring an idea from Kanban in -- 'item types.' This was helpful at
an all-day monthly meeting one of our teams have. We created a special
designation (color of sticky works, as pictured above, or a separate section in the backlog)
for items that are "_Today Or They Die_" -- things which will happen
between now and the next meeting, regardless of if we discuss them or
not. If it's December 1, and your next Meeting is Jan 1, you should
probably make your Christmas plans.

This can help with voting; those items may still not end up getting
selected for discussion, but at least the team has a shared
understanding that we're letting the opportunity pass.

It's mentioned in the linked articles, but the feature of being able to
discover new items "on the fly" and work them seamlessly into the
backlog is amazingly useful. In life [things are fundamentally interconnected](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Gently#Holistic_detective)
so it's to be expected and encouraged that we'll discover or create things that
_need_ discussion as a _function of_ discussion. Agendas hate this idea.

## Democratization

The 'everyone gets N votes' method works well. We also experimented with a few other methods of prioritization:

* "If you only get to discuss one thing today...": each member gets to select one item to bring into To Do. Perhaps more Socialist than Democratic, but it was a nice way to start off the day.  
* "Lightning Round": Are there any topics remaining in the backlog we can get through productively in 5 minutes or less? This was a fun way to get back into things after a lunch break, but somewhat risky -- one of the items selected turned into a 45 minute discussion.

One challenge with voting early in the discussion, particularly for
all-day meetings, is allowing priority to evolve over time as perspectives and
time pressures change. Using voting just to bring a few items into the ready queue, and
then voting again (from scratch) to repopulate when it empties, seemed to work well.

## Conclusion

This way of organizing meetings has really enhanced the quality of our
discussions and the value they deliver. It ends up feeling much more
natural -- still providing the compass and context we're frustrated
about not having in a truly chaotic meeting, without the rigidity and
creator bias that an agenda brings. After two separate meetings,
participants made comments like "that was the most productive and
engaging meeting I've ever been a part of." That's reason enough to
continue exploring!
