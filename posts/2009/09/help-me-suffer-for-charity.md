I'm raising money for the [Wounded Warrior Project](http://woundedwarriorproject.org/) and [Athletes For A Cure](http://afacblog.org/) (Prostate Cancer Research) by participating in something called [Fight Gone Bad](http://www.fgb4.org/).

The short version is this:
<ol>
  <li>You donate</li>
  <li>I go and REALLY REALLY bust my butt</li>
  <li>I vomit (optional)</li>
  <li>We help out some deserving people and (for those of us with prostates) maybe even ourselves.</li>
</ol>

"But Josh, how do I do this?" You ask.
Good question! Just go to my easy-to-remember donation page:
[http://j.mp/WatchJoshSweat](http://j.mp/WatchJoshSweat)
In 30 seconds you can enter the amount you'd like to donate and a credit card number. Very easy!

** Update:

Some people were curious about what the workout itself is.

Straight from the Crossfit FAQ:

> In this workout you move from each of five stations after a minute. This is a five-minute round from which a one-minute break is allowed before repeating. The workout is a total of 3 rounds.
> 
> The stations are:
>  1. Wall-ball: 20 pound ball, 10 ft target. (Reps)
>  2. Sumo deadlift high-pull: 75 pounds (Reps)
>  3. Box Jump: 20" box (Reps)
>  4. Push-press: 75 pounds (Reps)
>  5. Row: calories (Calories)
> The clock does not reset or stop between exercises. On call of "rotate," the athlete/s must move to next station immediately for good score. One point is given for each rep, except on the rower where each calorie is one point.
