I've been working on a lot of fun things both personally and for my company. However, I haven't prioritized blogging about it. Maybe I should add a GTD recurring task to 'blog about what's on my plate.'

Things I've been focusing on:

Learning more about agile methods, especially as it pertains to to dealing with teams that have operational requirements as well. 

Working more with my OpenSolaris NAS. Suprisingly, one of my most popular ever blog articles. 

Playing lots of music: I'm playing bass and guitar in my cover band's summer concert this weekend. (Can't wait!)

Planning an epic road trip for the summer: 5 weeks up the West Coast, starting in July.

And, of course, loving my little 5 month old!

So, more blogs to come.
