I found this today and I already love it.

It does 2 amazing things:
<ol>
<li>Moves the tabs to the left. On a widescreen computer this makes more sense than stealing Y-axis resolution. Also, I have to create a LOT of tabs before I start scrolling, which used to be a frequent annoyance. (If you prefer things to be on top/bottom/right, you can choose that in the preferences.)</li>
<li>Shows which page the tab 'came from' in a nice tree view. This is so nice for dealing with a tab overload efficiently -- I often find that I am researching several aspects of something at the same time. Even the fact that my tabs can be gathered up under their respective google searches is useful.</li>
</ol>

You can install it at [Mozilla Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5890). Check there for more screenshots and a full list of the features. 

Here is a simple example of it in action:
