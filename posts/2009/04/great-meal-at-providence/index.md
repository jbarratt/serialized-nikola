Last night we had a delicious and amazing dinner, celebrating Amber's 27th birthday, at Providence.

It was a '5x5 Chefs Collaborative', meaning 5 local chefs (and 1 guest chef, Alex Stratta) hung out together and handled one course each.

They gave us a menu to take home that I've attached. All the chefs signed it, which was a nice touch I'd never seen before.

The menu: [Providence 5x5 Signed Menu.pdf](/images/providence-5x5-signed-menu.pdf)

Every course was incredible. Our favorite courses were probably the amuses, the hamachi sashimi, and the best testament to the power of sous vide I've had in a long time -- Alex Stratta's duck.

Yum.
