We just arrived at the lovely Sofitel in Philadelphia, where we'll be spending the evening. I just checked the stats display on the GPS (I reset the counters before we left) and thought I'd share:

Total Miles Driven: 2,382.63

Total moving time: 46:42

Also, we both finished the new Harry Potter book (thanks to the drive from Northern Maine to Ithaca, NY for the time to finish them up.)
