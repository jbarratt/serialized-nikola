.. title: Telling Technology Stories with IPython Notebook
.. slug: ipython-notebook-storytelling

In my role at `Media Temple <http://mediatemple.net/>`_, I end up doing a lot of
ad-hoc analysis, looking at things a diverse as how our infrastructures are
growing, to changes in the market, to trying to figure out how we can help our
customers better, and so on. As I discussed in the talk, it was becoming a more
and more frustrating process. I'd increasingly seen people mentioning something
called the `IPython Notebook <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_, and I finally
decided to give it a try.

It was love at first install. It helped dramatically with so many of the kinds
of tasks I was working on, and yet almost nobody I talked to had heard of it or
actually tried it out. So, I submitted talk proposals to a few conferences, and
was pleasantly suprised when it was accepted by both `OSCON
<http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014>`_ and `LinuxCon
<http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-north-america>`_. (Extra special
thanks to my local `Python Meetup, #pdxpython <http://www.meetup.com/pdxpython/>`_, 
for letting me practice before OSCON, and giving me some extremely constructive 
feedback which really improved the talk.)

I got a lot of nice feedback about the talk, including this extremely kind
comment from `Fernando Perez <https://twitter.com/fperez_org>`_, the project's
founder:

The OSCON session was recorded, and thanks to their speaker-friendly video
agreement, I'm allowed to share their video with you here.

The best way to see the slides is live, with a running IPython Notebook. You can
get all the code (and the instructions to get started) in the `talk's github
repo <https://github.com/jbarratt/ipython_notebook_presentation>`_.

If you want a preview, you can check out the `fullscreen slides
</ipython_notebook_talk/>`_ or see it inline right here, but please note that
much of the talk is 'live' IPython Notebook demos, and the links to them will
not work.
