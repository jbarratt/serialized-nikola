In [March](/2009/03/my-approach-to-inbox-zero-with-mailapp/) and [December](/2009/12/updated-inbox-zero-with-mail-app-technique/) of 2009 I described how to do the [Inbox Zero](http://inboxzero.com/) method with Mac Mail, often known as `Mail.app`.

Since publishing those articles I'd been fed up with the performance of all the methods I'd been using, and finally switched over to a true beast of a mail processing machine, [Mail Act-On](http://www.indev.ca/MailActOn.html). The native plugin performance was great, and I was pretty happy with this solution.

The only thing I wasn't happy with was that I was still only using the single feature -- the ability to, with a hotkey, move mail into an archive folder. And for this, I'd happily paid.

However, I was recently contacted by the developer of the perfect plugin for me -- [Archive, a button for Apple Mail.](http://stl.techinno.nl/archive/). It does Archive and nothing else. It's a native plugin so it's fast, fast, fast. You don't have to jump through any of the hoops of Applescripting and Service menus and Quicksilver.

I've been using it for a few weeks now and it's been perfect -- clean, simple, and exactly what I wanted all along.

It's free, and you can download it from [the author's site](http://stl.techinno.nl/archive/).
