I've migrated my site from [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) to [Jekyll](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/). 
You can see where the donuts are made in the [source](http://github.com/jbarratt/serialized.net).
This is a much more programmer-y way to blog, including very nice baked in server-side syntax highlighting.

I apologize if your feed reader gets my entire posting history back, I've got a few nice articles in draft that I hope to get up soon so it should be worth staying subscribed.
