Incredible stuff, a very enjoyable ride once I got my head into it. I found it a bit like reading Shakespeare -- slow going at first, but once you become acquainted with the verbal stylings and the characters, it doesn't need any help to drive itself. I just found it funny how many people out there felt the need (as did I) to document finally completing the series -- it very much feels like an accomplishment above and beyond finishing a more 'conventional' book or series. I'd also like to throw my vote in for the "can't write an ending" stigma being finally lifted.
