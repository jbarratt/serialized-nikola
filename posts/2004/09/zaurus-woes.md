If you are trying to reflash a zaurus 5500 to the Sharp Rom, and see an error message a little something like this: Couldn't find ext2 superblock, followed by a request for you to enter maintenence mode with a little CTRL-D action -- pull the CF card out and do a hard reset. You'll be back in business in no time.
